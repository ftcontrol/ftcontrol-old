# üåü Field View
The Field View  in FTControl provides a dynamic and interactive visualization of the game field, allowing teams to monitor their robot's position, orientation, and interactions with game elements in real-time. This feature is particularly useful for debugging autonomous flows, tracking robot movements, and analyzing gameplay strategies. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas
The Field View supports various types of graphical objects that can be styled and rendered on the virtual field. These objects are drawn in the order they are sent to the `debug` function, and their layering (z-index) is automatically managed by the system. The input order is flexible, you can provide Drawable objects and text lines in any order within the debug function.

## üé® Supported Objects
1. Line
2. Circle
3. Rectangle

Every Drawable object requires a `look` to define its visual appearance. The look specifies styling attributes such as fillColor, outlineColor, outlineWidth.
